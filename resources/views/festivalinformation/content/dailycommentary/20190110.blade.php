<h4 class="{{ $h4class }}">Day 1: Thursday, 10 January</h4>
<p class="{{ $pclass }}">Arrive at the airport, buy a metrocard, and take the bus into the city until you reach Hindmarsh Square at the end of the line. From there, it’s a short walk along Pulteney Street to the university where you can meet us for registration and sign in.</p>
<p class="{{ $pclass }}">Once you are signed in, the day is at leisure until the first rehearsal at 5:00&nbsp;PM. The evening after rehearsal is at leisure, and you’re welcome to join the group for dinner and drinks.</p>
<h5 class="{{ $h5class }}">AIVCC</h5>
<p class="{{ $pclass }}">Those attending AIVCC will need to arrive and complete sign in before 11:00&nbsp;AM.</p>
<h5 class="{{ $h5class }}">Billeting</h5>
<p class="{{ $pclass }}">At some time during the week before you get on your flight, you should have been in contact with your billeting host to organise how to coordinate things. Don’t expect your host to meet you, and you might need to take public transport to their home in the evening (with your luggage).</p>
<h5 class="{{ $h5class }}">Luggage</h5>
<p class="{{ $pclass }}">It might be wise to pack an overnight bag and leave your main luggage at the rehearsal venue overnight. If your host is meeting you during the day and has a car, this might not be necessary, but please check with them before you pack for your flight so you know what’s best for your situation.</p>
<h5 class="{{ $h5class }}">Meals</h5>
<p class="{{ $pclass }}">You are responsible for your own meals while not at camp, except at special catered events. Most billeting hosts choose to provide breakfast, but if not, use your time at leisure today to buy food for that if necessary.</p>
