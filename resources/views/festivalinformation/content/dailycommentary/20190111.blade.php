<p class="{{ $pclass }}">Rehearsals at Rumours begin at 9:30&nbsp;AM. We break at 1:00&nbsp;PM and travel to camp by train. Those who have cars are welcome to drive instead.</p>

<h5 class="{{ $h5class }}">Luggage</h5>
<p class="{{ $pclass }}">You should have everything you need for camp with you at the beginning of rehearsal. Space in the dormitories at camp is very limited, don’t bring big bags. If you are billeted, it might be possible to leave some things with them until you return from camp, check this with your hosts.</p>
<p class="{{ $pclass }}">Bags can be left behind in Rumours while you get lunch, there’ll be someone there to look after the place. Be sure to pick them up again before 2:15 so we can lock up. Don’t leave anything behind in Rumours.</p>

The walk from the station is 450&nbsp;m.</p>
<p class="{{ $pclass }}">Car drivers will be doing luggage runs between Pinera station and Nunyara so you don’t have to carry it while walking.</p>

<h5 class="{{ $h5class }}">Lunch</h5>
<p class="{{ $pclass }}">You can find lunch in the city before taking the train, or you can have lunch in Belair. Whatever you do, plan to arrive at Nunyara before 3:00 to give you time to settle and find a bed.</p>
