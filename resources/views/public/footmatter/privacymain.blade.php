<h4 class="{{ $h4class }}">About this policy</h4>
<h5 class="{{ $h5class }}">Purpose</h5>
<p class="{{ $pclass }}">The purpose of this privacy policy is to communicate clearly the personal information handling practices we follow when we collect and deal with your personal information, including how you can contact us if you wish to correct or access personal information we hold about you.</p>
<h5 class="{{ $h5class }}">Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)</h5>
<p class="{{ $pclass }}">As a small business, we are exempted from the operation of the Privacy Act. However, protection of your personal information that we collect is very important to us. This policy sets out how we handle any personal information we collect or receive about you.</p>
<p class="{{ $pclass }}">The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) can be viewed at <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/pa1988108/">http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/pa1988108/</a>.</p>
<h5 class="{{ $h5class }}">How is our privacy policy structured?</h5>
<p class="{{ $pclass }}">Our privacy policy is ‘layered’ as it is presented in three layers. The first layer is the Privacy icon shown on the bottom of the web page in which we collect your personal information. It provides a quick snapshot of our information handling practices. The second layer, the one page summary that you reach from the icon link, provides you with a summary of how we collect, use, disclose and store your personal information, how you can contact us and which Act applies to our activities. The third layer is this full privacy policy that provides a more detailed explanation of our information handling procedures.</p>
